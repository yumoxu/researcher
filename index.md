# About

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.jpg">

Welcome! I am a second-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the University of Edinburgh. I am affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and also a member of [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) (principle) and [Dr. Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).

My office is at IF 3.34.   

Check out my [Github](https://github.com/yumoxu), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yumo-xu-aa81aba5) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yumo_xu), or [email me](mailto:yumo.xu@ed.ac.uk).   

# Research

I am interested in both deep learning techniques and probabilistic models for NLP tasks, especially text summarization and sentiment analysis. My long-term goal is to benefit natural language understanding from distant signals in weakly supervised settings and I am currently working on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) for Domain Detection and Summarization.
