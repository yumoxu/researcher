# **About Me**

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.JPG">

Welcome! I am a first-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at the University of Edinburgh. I am affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and aslo a member of [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) (principle) and [Dr. Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).

My office is at IF 5.08.

and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yumo_xu), or [email me](mailto:yumo.xu@ed.ac.uk).   

# **Research Interest**

I am interested in both deep learning techniques and probabilistic models for NLP tasks, especially text summarization and sentiment analysis. My long-term goal is to combine the two approaches properly and I am currently working on Neural Variational Inference (NVI).
