## ABOUT ME

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.JPG">

Hi! I am a first-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing at the University of Edinburgh. I am affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and [the Edinburgh Natural Language Processing Group (EdinburghNLP)](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) (principle) and [Dr. Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).


## RESEARCH INTEREST

I am interested in both deep learning techniques and probabilistic models for NLP tasks, including text summarisation, machine translation and opinion mining. My long-term goal is to combine the two approaches properly for NLP applications. I am currently working on Neural Variational Inference (NVI).
