## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="photo.JPG">

Welcome! I am a first-year PhD student in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at The University of Edinburgh. I am affiliated with [the Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) and [EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/) (principle) and [Dr. Shay Cohen](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/scohen/).


## Research Interest

I am interested in both deep learning techniques and probabilistic models for NLP tasks, especially text summarization. My long-term goal is to combine the two approaches properly and I am currently working on Neural Variational Inference (NVI).
